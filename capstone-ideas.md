## Capstone Ideas

Things I like outside of data: history, reading, video games, museums, the UK.


### Predicting the success of a YA novel
- using NYT information on release date, author, length, sub-genre, can the success of a YA novel be known before release day

### Ships departing England for Europe 1700-1800
- If such a data set exists
- Tracking any fluxuations in number of departures, cargo, destination to line up with conflicts of the period

### Factors in success of video game consoles
- Using sales data, release date information, consumer satisfaction index
- Similar to idea #1 examining the releases of next-gen consoles for trends and factors that impacted long-term success

### Has the code school industry had an impact on traditional CS enrollment?
- As coding schools/alternative education become more popular, have computer science departments seen a decrease in applicants? (Remember 'correlation is not causality')
- Tracking schools in cities with prominent bootcamps?

### What insights can be gathered from reviewing English Heritage visitor stats in the age of austerity?
- How have heritage sites fared while all of Europe has tightened its belt?
- More school tours? More int'l visitors? 

### Change in the make up of history majors at one university over a period of 50 years
- Are the humanities dying? Or are the same people going into history who always have?
- A university with a strong history program? Or a less well-known one?

### Something, something Carolina Hurricanes
- I like hockey, but traditional sports statistics don't interest me
